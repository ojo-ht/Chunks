<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<h1>Self-Knowledge</h1>

<p>The problems of the world are so colossal, so very complex, that to understand
and so to resolve them one must approach them in a very simple and direct
manner; and simplicity, directness, do not depend on outward circumstances nor
on our particular prejudices and moods. As I was pointing out, our solution is
not to be found through conferences, blue-prints, or through the substitution of
new leaders for old, and so on. The solution obviously lies in the creator of
the problem, in the creator of the mischief, of the hate and of the enormous
misunderstanding that exists between human beings. The creator of this mischief,
the creator of these problems is the individual, you and I, not the world as we
think of it. The world is your relationship with another. The world is not
something separate from you and me; the world, society, is the relationship that
we establish or seek to establish between each other.</p>

<p>So you and I are the problem, and not the world, because the world is the
projection of ourselves and to understand the world we must understand
ourselves. The world is not separate from us, we are the world, and our problems
are the world's problems. This cannot be repeated too often, because we are so
sluggish in our mentality that we think the world's problems are not our
business, that they have to be resolved by the United Nations or by substituting
new leaders for the old. It is a very dull mentality that thinks like that,
because we are responsible for this frightful misery and confusion in the world,
this ever-impending war. To transform the world, we must begin with ourselves;
and what is important in beginning with ourselves is the intention. The
intention must be to understand ourselves and not to leave it to others to
transform themselves or to bring about a modified change through revoltion,
either of the left or of the right. It is important to understand that this is
our responsibility, yours and mine; because, however small may be the world we
live in, if we can transform ourselves, bring about a radically different point
of view in our daily existence, then perhaps we shall affect the world at large,
the extended relationship with others.</p>

<p>As I said, we are going to try and find out the process of understanding
ourselves, which is not an isolating process. it is not withdrawal from the
world, because you cannot live in isolatin. To be is to be related, and there is
no such thing as living in isolation. It is the lack of right relationship that
brings about conflicts, misery and strife; however small our world may be, if we
can transform our relationship in that narrow world, it will be like a wave
extending outward all the time. I think it is important to see that point, that
the world is our relationship, however narrow; and if we can bring a
tranformation there, not a superficial but a radical transformation, then we
shall begin actively to transform the world. Real revolution is not according to
any particular pattern, either of the left or of the right, but it is a
revolution of values, a revolution from sensate values to the values that are
not sensate or created by environmental influences. To find these true values
which will bring about a radical revolution, a transformation or a regeneration,
it is essential to understand oneself. Self-knowledge is the beginning of
wisdom, and therefore the beginning of transformation or regeneration. To
understand oneself there must be the intention to understand\&amp;emdash</p>
