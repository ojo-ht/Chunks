<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<h1>Self-Knowledge</h1>

<p>The problems of the world are so colossal, so very complex, that to understand
and so to resolve them one must approach them in a very simple and direct
manner; and simplicity, directness, do not depend on outward circumstances nor
on our particular prjucices and moods. As I was pointing out, our solution is
not to be found through conferences, blue-prints, or through the substitution of
new leaders for old, and so on. The solution obviously lies in the creator of
the problem, in the creator of the mischief, of the hate and of the enormous
misunderstanding that exists between human beings. The creator of this mischief,
the creator of these problem,s is the individual, you and I, not the world as we
think of it. The world is your relationship with another. The world is not
something separate from you and me; the world, society, is the relationship that
we establish or seek to establish between each other.</p>

<p>So you and I are the problem, and not the world, because the world is the
projection of ourselves and to understand the world we must understand
ourselves. The world is not separate from us, we are the world, and our problems
are the world's problems. This cannot be repeated too often, because we are so
sluggish in our mentality that we think the world's problems are not our
business, that they have to be resolved by the United Nations or by substituting
new leaders for the old. It is a very dull mentality that thinks like that,
because we are responsible for this frightful misery and confusion in the world,
this ever-impending war. To transform the world, we must begin with ourselves;
and what is important in beginning with ourselves is the intention. The
intention must be to understand ourselves and not to leave it to others to
transform themselves or to bring about a modified change through revoltion,
either of the left or of the right. It is important to understand that this is
our responsibility, yours and mine; because, however small may be the world we
live in, if we can transform ourselves, bring about a radically different point
of view in our daily existence, then perhaps we shall affect the world at large,
the extended relationship with others.</p>
